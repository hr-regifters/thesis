# Ripple #
 
## Heading ##
  Ripple interconnects all the apps you love.

## Sub-Heading ##
  Ripple is a client-facing app geared towards tech-oriented users to help them automate their use of web services.

## Summary ##
  Ripple is all about chain reactions. When you post a photo in Instagram, Ripple will upload it to your Dropbox. When you pin a message in Slack, Ripple will save it to your Evernote. In Ripple, a relationship between multiple apps is called a concoction. A concoction follows basic cause and effect logic. Select a trigger app and event, then choose your action app and event. Ripple will take care of the rest! Once you've made your concoction, Ripple will keep listening in the background. Concoctions last as long as you want them to and when you no longer want to use a concoction, just click the disable toggle!

## Problem ##
  Too many web services, not enough time!

## Solution ##
  One simple app that automates the web services you use in no time!
